## About
This repo contains the code for the [unrealcpp.com](https://www.unrealcpp.com) tutorials, ported from C++ to Haxe.

## UE4 and Haxe
Using Haxe in UE4 is made possible thanks to the fantastic [Unreal.Hx](https://github.com/proletariatgames/unreal.hx) plugin. Being a non-official plugin, it currently has few code samples for interacting with UE4's C++ API. Hopefully this repo can get you started.

## Setup
    Detailed instructions coming soon. To get started, install VS Code and the Haxe Extension Pack plugin and make sure to switch the active Haxe configuration in VS Code to use the `gen-compl-script-hxml` file instead of `arguments.hxml`, as the latter is the default choice and will get VS Code stuck on building the Haxe cache forever and fail to provide any intellisense features.
